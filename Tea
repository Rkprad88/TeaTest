The tea protocol is an ecosystem that allows developers to earn rewards for their contributions to open-source software (OSS). By onboarding as an OSS developer and registering your projects on the tea protocol, you can gain visibility, attract potential contributors and users, and track the dynamic impact and utilization of your projects. Additionally, by staking TEA tokens on your project or others', you can actively participate in the governance and growth of the ecosystem.
